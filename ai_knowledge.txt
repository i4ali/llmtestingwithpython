Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create intelligent machines 
that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include learning, 
reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding.

Machine Learning is a subset of AI that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and 
improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on the development of 
computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers 
(deep neural networks) to model and understand complex patterns in data. It has been particularly 
successful in areas like image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of AI that focuses on the interaction between 
computers and humans through natural language. The ultimate objective of NLP is to read, 
decipher, understand, and make sense of human languages in a valuable way.
